                emgrande cuisine is a style of cooking characterised by meticulous
                preparation, elaborate presentation, and the use of high quality
                ingredients. Typically prepared by highly skilled gourmet chefs,
                haute cuisine dishes are renowned for their high quality and are
                often offered at premium prices. Haute cuisine represents the
